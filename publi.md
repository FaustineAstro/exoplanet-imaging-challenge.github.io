## Publication of the results 

After the first phase of the exoplanet imaging data challenge (ending Monday 1st of June 2020 at 11.59am CET), the results of the submission will be gathered in an SPIE conference proceeding. 
The proceeding is the result of a poster presented at SPIE *Astronomical Telescope + Instrumentation* taking place in Yokohama (Japan) from the 14th to the 19th of June 2020 (<https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/astronomical-telescopes-and-instrumentation?SSO=1>). 

**All participants to the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge** will be invited to co-author the proceeding. 

The proceeding will then be available on the present page before continuing to the next phase.


## Future of the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge

If successful, we intend to organizing regularly this data challenge, and make it evolve to include more features (e.g. planet characterization, disk extraction etc.). 

The idea is to publish the results every two years, under the form of an SPIE *Astronomical Telescope + Instrumentation* proceeding.

The data will be available permanently on the Zenodo repository so that anyone can test her/his algorithm on these data set and compare it to the published results.
