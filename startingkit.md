title: Starting kit and extras repository
---

The implementations of the planet injection, source counting and ROC curve generation algorithms are included in the open source [Vortex Image Processing package](https://github.com/vortex-exoplanet/VIP) for the sake of transparency and fairness. Other code related to the data challenge is available at the [Data Challenge Extras repository](https://github.com/carlgogo/exoimaging_challenge_extras). Here we also share a Python script (``DC1_codalab_starting_kit.py``) that illustrates how to create the outputs to be submitted for participating in the data challenge.
 
The extras repository also contains a data challenge starting kit, in the form of a Jupyter notebook (``DC1_starting_kit.ipynb``), which explains in detail the source counting procedure on detection maps (to get the true and false positives). The starting kit can also be executed on the cloud thanks to [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/carlgogo/exoimaging_challenge_extras/master). This implementation shall serve as a reference for future studies on image processing algorithms for direct imaging of exoplanets.
