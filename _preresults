**On this page, we present the results obtained during the test phase of the data challenge (deadline January 2020).** 
The feedbacks of this test phase were useful to improve the data challenge as a whole before settling the new deadline set (1st of June 2020). 
We warmly thanks the participants who have submitted their results for this first test phase. 

Note that the results submitted during the phase test are valid for the final phase 1 (ending 1st of June 2020). 

Among the 51 participants who have registered on CodaLab, we received *9 submissions*. 
We publish here the results from the ADI sub-challenge (*subchallenge_1*) on the data *SPHERE_IRDIS_3*.
