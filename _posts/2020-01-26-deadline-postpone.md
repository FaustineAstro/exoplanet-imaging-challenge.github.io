After noticing an error message for several submission, we postponed the deadline to the 28/01/2020 at 1pm CET. For the submission, the file 'detection_threshold.fits' must contain a 1x1 vector with a single value of threshold to be used for all of the submitted detection map. Do not hesitate to contact the administrator under CodaLab in case of further problems when submitting.
