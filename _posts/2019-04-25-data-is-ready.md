During the past few months, we have reached out to several instrument scientists requesting datasets that could be used in the context of a community challenge. We are glad to report that we have collected nineteen datasets from 5 instruments and that we have worked hard to homogenize the data. See the section "Datasets" for more details. We plan to launch the challenge in the coming week, once we have injected a final batch of synthetic companions on the datasets.
