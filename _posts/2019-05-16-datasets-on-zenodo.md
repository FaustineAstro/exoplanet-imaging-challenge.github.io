We are happy to announce that the challenge datasets (containing synthetic companions/planets) are ready and have been uploaded to [Zenodo]([here](https://zenodo.org/record/2815298)).

On this repository, you can find two zip files: ``Subchallenge 1.zip`` (2.0 GB) and ``Subchallenge 2.zip`` (2.5 GB), corresponding to each sub-challenge. If you want to participate, please download the zip files and produce a detection map for each one of them. If you don't know how to process high-contrast imaging data cubes then here are a few pointers:

* [Context and objectives](https://exoplanet-imaging-challenge.github.io/context/)  of this challenge.
* Information about the [sub-challenges](https://exoplanet-imaging-challenge.github.io/subchallenges) and [datasets](https://exoplanet-imaging-challenge.github.io/datasets/).
* [Vortex Image Processing](https://vip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (VIP) library (for Python).
* [VIP's tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/carlgogo/VIP_extras/blob/master/tutorials/01_adi_pre-postproc_fluxpos_ccs.ipynb).

Finally, if you feel like participating then go to [Codalab](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/22836) and submit your results.
