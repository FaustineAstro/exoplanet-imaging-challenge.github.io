After receiving feedbacks from the community, we have decided to carry on the data challenge until the **Monday 1st of June 2020**. 
The results of this first phase will be published in an SPIE-conference proceeding (Astronomy Telescope + Instrumentation, Yokohama, Japan). 
Every participant will be contacted and invited to co-author the proceeding. 
In the meantime, have fun !
