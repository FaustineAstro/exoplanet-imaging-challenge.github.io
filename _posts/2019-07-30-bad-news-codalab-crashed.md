title: Bad news! Codalab suffered a major crash and the competition was lost
comments: true

We've recently became aware of the fact that the exoplanet imaging competition disappeared from Codalab. According to Codalab maintainers, their system suffered a major crash and Codalab was restored from a backup done before our competition was uploaded. This means that our competition was lost (!!!) and will have to be restarted. Codalab also promises to put in place a better backup and recovery procedure.

Our plan is to re-create the exoplanet imaging competition on Codalab, hoping that this problem won't happen again. We will announce it with a new post on this website and let know the specialized (high-contras imaging) community via the usual mailing lists and channels.
