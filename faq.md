* Can I submit results corresponding to only a subset of the proposed datasets?
> You can participate in either sub-challenge (see the [sub-challenges section](https://exoplanet-imaging-challenge.github.io/subchallenges)) by submitting the detection maps corresponding to each dataset (nine for the first sub-challenge and ten for the second one) and a detection threshold. A partial submission for a given sub-challenge is possible, e.g. five detection maps for the first sub-challenge (instead of nine), but that will penalize the metrics computations and your score (see the [metrics section](https://exoplanet-imaging-challenge.github.io/metrics)).
